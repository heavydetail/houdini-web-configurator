This is a very basic prototype consisting of a python flask API that connects to houdini, configures an asset via node parameters and then outputs the file as glTF with a unique ID so it can be picked up and displayed by a web frontend in three.js where parameters of the asset can be changed which trigger an update cycle through the API. This would allow us to create a web configurator for houdini assets. Our goal was to test whether a product configurator is feasible. There are many issues that would need to be solved from licensing for concurrent users, queue processing, streaming file transfer to interface and integration development. Alas, time is limited for tests like this maybe this can serve as a starting point for someone.
